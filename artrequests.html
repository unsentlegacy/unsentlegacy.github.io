<div class="note red">THIS PAGE IS UNDER HEAVY CONSTRUCTION.</div>

<h1><span class="red">Art</span> <span class="green">Portfolio</span> <span class="blue">and</span> <span class="yellow">Requests</span></h1>

<div id="about" class="main">
Here you will find my art on display as well as a form to fill out for commissions. I do paid commissions for both Neopoints and Items. How much you ask? I personally use the bribe system:

<ul>
<li class="red">Make me an offer (minimum 200k for busts, for other types of pieces see pricing information below).</li>
<li class="green">Highest <b class="red">THREE</b> offers make the cut guaranteed. Any offers lower than the first three but above the minimum are next in line in priority, slot space is limited and designated once comms are opened up.</li>
<li class="blue">I open up bribes for one week at a time, again, slots will be limited, but there will usually be 5 maximum. The order of piece completion goes in order of the offers from highest to lowest.</li>
<li class="yellow">If your offer is bumped by other players I will neomail your or message you on Discord to let you know. You are welcome to reoffer to reclaim your spot if you wish.</li>
</ul>

<div class="note">Once the art is yours you are allowed to do with it what you wish barring using it in any sort of contest. Please note I reserve the right to refused an offer for any reason, particularly reasons regarding subject matter. (Important: I only do gijinka as a form of anthropimazation, I do <b class="red">NOT</b> do art of furries of any kind, apologies in advance!)</div>

<p>To request a piece please PM me on NPC (un: UnsentLegacy) during open request periods. You are <b class="green">FREE to ask what my otbs are for certain slots</b>. When requesting I will inform you of the current minimum to obtain a slot, if I don't inform you of a minimum it's fine to assume that current baseline price (200K) is acceptable.</p>
